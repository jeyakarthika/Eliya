BareBones
=========

A very minimal starter template for my Front End Projects.

Each time I start a new project, I find myself copying the folder and file structure from previous projects (Pure Laziness, I know!). So, I thought I will better make a bare bones minimal template to help me kickoff a new project faster. I know there are a lot of starter templates out there. But, they are very bloated and requires lot of deleting. 

So, This template contains a HTML index file and folders to keep the styles, javascript and images organized. I use Eric Meyer's CSS reset for the moment. 

I intend to keep updating this template, so that I can adapt it to reflect my requirements as I learn more. Any feedback and suggestions are welcome.
